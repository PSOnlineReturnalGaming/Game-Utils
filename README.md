# Game-Utils
The aim of this will be to supply game resources for older games that need changes to allow for online play.

This repo serves to provide game patches, bypasses, and more for your favorite titles that we support on PSORG, among other information that will be useful for restoring online games!

If you have curated or found a better DNAS bypass code, please do a pull request and we will add it!
Some games that require an bypass code, but one isn't supplied here, use krHACKen's DNAS patcher CLI tool to attempt a patch which can be found here: https://www.psx-place.com/threads/dnas-net-patcher.22813/
## Utilizing krHACKen's DNAS Patcher
You yourself can get DNAS Bypass codes by going into PCSX2 DNAS supported PS2 game, attempt DNAS and do a SAVE STATE to a FILE.
This Save State file has the DNAS Library information for krHACKen's DNAS Patcher program if the DNAS Patcher cannot find the DNAS Libraries in the game itself.
